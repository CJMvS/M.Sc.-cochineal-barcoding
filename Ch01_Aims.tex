\section{Aims}

The aims of this Master's thesis were to: 
\vspace{0.4cm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Obtain DNA and molecular barcode data to create phylogenies for the Dactylopiidae.
    \item Test the accuracy of these barcode databases.
    \item Develop protocols to allow for the accurate and quick identification of species, and more importantly, intraspecific lineages within \textit{Dactylopius opuntiae} and \textit{D. tomentosus}.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent To date, a number of distinct genetic lineages of \textit{D. tomentosus} have been determined (e.g. \citet{Mathenge2009, Mathenge2010}), but not for \textit{D. opuntiae} (namely the `ficus' and `stricta' lineages). Filling this knowledge gap is very valuable to the biological control of invasive Cactaceae around the world, and offers a number of important  practical applications.
